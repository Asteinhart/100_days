Kendi takes us through multiple aspects of racism from class to gender to sexuality however, he never really addresses the intersectionality of these issues. The main premise of the book is laid out well, you either are racist or antiracist, really trying to get at the idea that not actively taking action is being complicit to racist systems.<br/>Aside: Parts of the authors own story remind me of the Ta-Nehisi Coates article ""This Is How We Lost to the White Man"" about the ""audacity of Bill Cosby’s black conservatism"" which I seem to be referencing  more and more recently. <br/>Overall, this book, like many others, felt like it a book about race (i.e. Black people) written for white people in a way as to be as descriptive as possible without causing major discomfort for white people, in an effort (I am assuming) to still allow the book to be ""popular"" and top of every list once white people want to finally take racial justice seriously. In other words, I would assume that a book that spoke to a more radical vision of racial justice than this one would not be as ""popular"" to non-Black people. I say all that to say, I think there are certain concessions you have to make to write about race to a white audience although I assume to understand the rational behind it, it's still disappointing. <br/><br/>I would not recommend this book for people at the beginning of their racial justice journey personally.<br/><br/>Noted Quotes:<br/>pg. 208 "" Moral and educational suasion breathes the assumption that racist minds must change before racist policy, ignoring history that says otherwise."" He then goes to talk about white support for desegregated after policies changed and other examples.<br/>This point makes me think about the ways the fight for LGBTQ equality has differed from the fight for racial equality. My understanding of the LGBTQ was one of the opposite, minds changed which then lead to policy change. Something to think about more.",,,1,,,0,,,,,
